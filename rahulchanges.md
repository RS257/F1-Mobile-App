# Rahul Bhatnagar Changes
I am interested in Android development; however, I only have Apple devices, so Rushi let me make changes to his app and then he tested/built it and then I revised my code.


A fix Rushi wanted me to work on was regarding user registration. Specifically, there was a bug where after registration the app crashed or would take you back to the registration login. I tried to fix this. We worked very closely on this, since I needed to watch the execution and see what happens. I needed to delete a few lines of code based on discussion of how the app works and how firebase is storing the user data for authentication.
